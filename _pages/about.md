## About me
I'm a PhD student working with [Payam Piray](https://www.piraylab.com/) at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on how the brain constructs flexible and general representations of the world, this is what I believe to be the key to our intelligence. 

Currently, I am interested in the principles behind how the brain constructs a "cogntive map" through the combination of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex.

### A more personal note
